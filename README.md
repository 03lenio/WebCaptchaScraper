    # this will call the global captcha count to count how many captchas you already have
    global captchaCount
    captchaCount += 1
    # here selenium finds the captcha image via its id and then screenshots it
    try:
        driver.find_element_by_id("captchaImage").screenshot("scraped/captcha" + str(captchaCount) + ".png")
    except:
        print("Something went wrong while trying to scrape, retrying...")
        grabCaptchas()
    print("Successfully grabbed captcha no." + str(captchaCount))
